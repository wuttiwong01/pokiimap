About
##################

**PokiiMap** is basically PokeVision on Android, an app to help you san for pokemons in a map, because it's really important to catch'em all!

**PokiiMap is a 3rd party PokemonGO client that is not affilicated with Niantic. Please read warnings and use at your own risks**

**PokiiMap is NOT a PokemonGo bot, it will NOT perform ANY actions AUTOMATICALLY without you pressing some buttons first**. You can catch/loot in PokiiMap but YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE THEM. If you don't enable and use catch/loot, PokiiMap is just very full featured pokemon scanner app. 

If you just want to use it, get the latest release `HERE`_
